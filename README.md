## What is Data Visualization?

-  **Data visualization** is the ability to convey a story or an idea as efficiently as possible.

- A picture is worth a thousands words.

- Makes it easy to identify certain pattern or disruptions in data.

- Made up of shapes, size and color e.g showing profit and loss of a data.

- Better than showing data in excel which can cause difficult in getting knowledge and idea of data related to.

  

### 1 Context-

Before you start data visualization, we need to know about some answers.

### 3 Removing

- It's common to recieve data with unnecessary information.

- It's up to you to decide if certain information should be displayed visually.

  

### 4 Draw attention using Shapes, Size & Color.

- If a user should focus on a certain part of the graph/chart, then use shape, size and color to highlight it.

- A lot of visual desginers don't take the time to data easily identifiable.

### Data Visualization are made up of 2 parts
|Data| Document  |
|--|--|
| Json, CSV, Plain text, etc | HTML Web Page |
| Data should drive the visaulization not the other way around. | Repersents the data. The visual will depend on the data itself and not dictate what the data should be |

> **Example** if your visual has extra space or room, then the document shouldn't change or add data. Instead the visual itself need to be adjusted, NOT THE DATA.
