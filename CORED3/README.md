# D3
D3 size is larger because of unuseful lot of data associated with it.
We can handle it by using the useful library of **D3** because developers have already break it for *Optimal Performance*.
D3 will only manage our **SVG** components for **HTML** to show data.

## UNDERSTANDING DATA
-	Data is everything e.g. Images, Audio, Files, Test files, Videos etc.
-	Data to D3 is more specific. It's only understand text and numbers.

### Where data is stored
-	Inside your JS code.
-	JSON
-	CSV
-	Text

### Two parts for Data Visualization
-	There is data itself - Text and Numbers.
	-	Example: Amount of dogs owners in the city; How many students hold a certain grade.
-	Then there  is a visual part i.e. HTML & CSS.
> Note: **D3** is a Liberary that breaches the gap between data & view and help us to manage that data driven part for HTML & CSS using SVG.
